This is not my best work for sure. I feel like they layout doesnt work very well and the 
style is boring and flat. I have plans to make it look and flow better for the FIP.

For some reason main Nav's links don't work but the style does and the footer Nav's links
work but the stlying doesnt? When we talk about the Midterms after would you mind telling 
me what happened there and how i could improve?

Also there is a lot of filler content or repeating content, I have plans to fill it with 
something different but i just didnt have time make all of my original content.

One last thing, the branding is more heavily leaning towards the Band-Aid brand over Collective 
Arts but that will be fixed later. I was planning of having the majority styling be band-aid
but have the concept of collective arts. So I will have beer bottles with different art on them 
i just didn't get to making them just yet.
