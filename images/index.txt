At Collective Arts we mix our beers with art. We believe that art inspires our beer and hopefully our beer inspires your art. Every 3 months we change the art on our bottles thanks to our loyal fans, and its not just visual art we accept. We want to hear what you have to say, or play. On our cases we offer a special code on the back so you get to hear great music while you slip some delicous beer. How awesome is that?

Our Main Brewery is based in Hamilton Ontario.  Our main distributer is the LCBO so you should be able to find us in any LCBO around Canada.

We Are expanding currently and are excited to announce that we will be opening a new brewery in Brooklyn!
